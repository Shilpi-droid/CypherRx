# Query Strategy Guidelines
# ==============================================================================

QUERY_STRATEGY = """
**CRITICAL: Understanding Query Intent - Use Chain of Thought Reasoning**

Before generating Cypher, analyze the query using these steps:

STEP 1: What is being TREATED? (The medical condition requiring treatment)
  - Look for disease names: "diabetes", "pneumonia", "UTI", "high cholesterol"
  - Look for drug classes and what they treat: "blood thinner" → treats AF/DVT
  - If not explicit, infer from drug class (e.g., "antibiotic" → infection)

STEP 2: What are the SAFETY CONSTRAINTS? (Patient conditions or medications to avoid)
  - Patient conditions: "pregnancy", "chronic kidney disease", "liver disease"
  - Current medications: "I'm on Warfarin" → check interactions
  - Avoid indicators: "unsafe", "should avoid", "contraindicated"

STEP 3: Choose the correct relationship pattern:
  - Treatment target → Use TREATS relationship
  - Safety constraint → Use CONTRAINDICATED_IN or NOT INTERACTS_WITH
  - "Safe" queries → Find drugs that treat X AND NOT contraindicated in Y
  - "Avoid" queries → Find drugs that ARE contraindicated in Y

**Key Patterns**:
1. "Which drugs treat X?" → Simple: MATCH (d:Drug)-[:TREATS]->(c:Condition {name: X})
2. "What does drug X interact with?" → MATCH (d:Drug {name: X})-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(other)
3. "Safe drugs for X with constraint Y" → TREATS X AND NOT CONTRAINDICATED_IN Y
4. "Which drugs to avoid in Y" → ARE CONTRAINDICATED_IN Y
"""


# ==============================================================================
# Important Cypher Rules
# ==============================================================================

CYPHER_RULES = """
**Important Rules**:
- ALWAYS use exact property matching: {{name: "Exact Name"}}
- For filtering (NOT conditions), use WHERE NOT (pattern)
- MUST return: name AS name, type AS type
- Keep queries simple and focused on finding starting nodes
- **CRITICAL**: type() function ONLY works on relationships, NOT nodes
  * For nodes: Use labels(node)[0] or a literal string like "Drug"
  * For relationships: Use type(relationship)
  * WRONG: type(n) where n is a node
  * RIGHT: labels(n)[0] or "Drug" for nodes

**CRITICAL: INTERACTS_WITH RELATIONSHIP DIRECTION**:
- INTERACTS_WITH is BIDIRECTIONAL - relationships can be stored in either direction
- ALWAYS use undirected relationship pattern: (d1)-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(d2)
- NEVER use directed: (d1)-[:INTERACTS_WITH]->(d2) or <-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(d2)
- This ensures you find interactions regardless of how they're stored in the graph
- Example: MATCH (d1:Drug {name: "Warfarin"})-[r:INTERACTS_WITH]-(d2:Drug {name: "Ibuprofen"})

**CRITICAL: INTERACTION_CHECK QUERIES (Can I take X with Y? / Is X safe with Y?)**:
- When the user asks "Can I take Drug1 and Drug2 together?" or "I'm on Drug1, is Drug2 safe?"
- This is an interaction_check query
- You MUST return BOTH drugs as starting nodes (not just one, not zero)
- The beam search will explore the INTERACTS_WITH relationship between them
- WRONG: Return only one drug, or use a directed INTERACTS_WITH query
- RIGHT: MATCH (d:Drug) WHERE d.name IN ["Drug1", "Drug2"] RETURN d.name AS name, "Drug" AS type
- Example: "I'm on Rivaroxaban and starting Erythromycin. Is this safe?"
  → Return BOTH Rivaroxaban and Erythromycin as starting nodes

**CRITICAL SAFETY DEFINITION**:
- In this knowledge graph, "safe" means: **NO `INTERACTS_WITH` relationship**
- If two drugs have NO `INTERACTS_WITH` edge → they are **safe together**
- If there IS an `INTERACTS_WITH` edge → **not safe**
- Use bidirectional check: NOT (d)-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(:Drug {name: "Warfarin"})


**CRITICAL: ANTIBIOTIC CLASS FILTERING**:
- "antibiotics" is NOT a drug class in the database!
- Database has specific antibiotic classes: Penicillin, Cephalosporin, Macrolide, Fluoroquinolone, Tetracycline, Nitrofuran, Antifolate, Sulfonamide, Glycopeptide, Nitroimidazole
- WRONG: WHERE toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "antibiotic"
- RIGHT: WHERE toLower(d.class) IN ["penicillin", "cephalosporin", "macrolide", "fluoroquinolone", "tetracycline", "nitrofuran", "antifolate", "sulfonamide", "glycopeptide", "nitroimidazole"]
- OR use partial match on actual classes: WHERE toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "penicillin" OR toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "cephalosporin" ...

**CRITICAL: RELATIONSHIP DIRECTION**
- TREATS goes FROM Drug TO Condition: (d:Drug)-[:TREATS]->(c:Condition)
- CONTRAINDICATED_IN goes FROM Drug TO Condition: (d:Drug)-[:CONTRAINDICATED_IN]->(c:Condition)

================================================================================
EXAMPLES WITH CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING:
================================================================================

Example 1: Simple treatment query
─────────────────────────────────
User: "What drugs treat Type 2 Diabetes?"

REASONING:
- Treatment target: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (explicit)
- Safety constraints: None
- Strategy: Simple TREATS query

CYPHER:
MATCH (d:Drug)-[:TREATS]->(c:Condition {name: "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"})
RETURN d.name AS name, "Drug" AS type

─────────────────────────────────
Example 2: Interaction check (one drug to all interactions)
─────────────────────────────────
User: "What does Warfarin interact with?"

REASONING:

MATCH (d:Drug {name: "Warfarin"})-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(other)
RETURN other.name AS name, labels(other)[0] AS type

─────────────────────────────────
Example 2b: Interaction check (two specific drugs)
─────────────────────────────────
User: "Can I take Rivaroxaban and Erythromycin together?"
User: "I'm on Rivaroxaban and starting Erythromycin. Is this safe?"

REASONING:
- Starting entities: Rivaroxaban, Erythromycin (both explicit drugs)
- Goal: Check if these two drugs interact
- Strategy: Bidirectional INTERACTS_WITH between the two drugs
- CRITICAL: Use BOTH drug names in the Cypher query to check interaction

CYPHER:
MATCH (d1:Drug)-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(d2:Drug)
WHERE d1.name IN ["Rivaroxaban", "Erythromycin"]
  AND d2.name IN ["Rivaroxaban", "Erythromycin"]

─────────────────────────────────
Example 3: Class-based interaction
─────────────────────────────────
User: "Does Simvastatin interact with any antibiotics?"

CYPHER:
MATCH (d:Drug {name: "Simvastatin"})-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(a:Drug)
WHERE toLower(a.class) CONTAINS "antibiotic"
RETURN a.name AS name, "Drug" AS type

─────────────────────────────────
Example 4: Safe drug with single constraint (patient condition)
─────────────────────────────────
User: "Which drugs treat Hypertension and are safe in Pregnancy?"

REASONING:
- Treatment target: Hypertension (explicit)

Example 5: Safe drug with drug interaction constraint
─────────────────────────────────
User: "Safe antibiotic for UTI with Warfarin?"

REASONING:
- Treatment target: Urinary Tract Infection (explicit)
- Drug class: antibiotic
- Safety constraint: Current medication Warfarin (check interactions)

RETURN d.name AS name, "Drug" AS type



─────────────────────────────────
Example 7: "Avoid" query - find contraindicated drugs
─────────────────────────────────
User: "Which statins are unsafe during pregnancy?"

REASONING:
- Drug class: statins

MATCH (d:Drug)-[:CONTRAINDICATED_IN]->(c:Condition {name: "Pregnancy"})
WHERE toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "statin"
RETURN d.name AS name, "Drug" AS type

─────────────────────────────────
Example 8: Avoid query with implied treatment
─────────────────────────────────
User: "I have atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease. Which blood thinner should I avoid?"

REASONING:
- Treatment target: Atrial Fibrillation (what blood thinners treat)
- Safety constraint: Chronic Kidney Disease (patient condition)
- Query intent: "avoid" = find contraindicated drugs
- Strategy: Find anticoagulants that ARE CONTRAINDICATED_IN CKD

CYPHER:
MATCH (d:Drug)-[:CONTRAINDICATED_IN]->(c:Condition {name: "Chronic Kidney Disease"})
WHERE (toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "doac" OR 
       toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "vitamin k antagonist" OR 
       toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "lmwh")
RETURN d.name AS name, "Drug" AS type

─────────────────────────────────
Example 9: Multi-constraint query
─────────────────────────────────
User: "I'm on Warfarin and need an antibiotic for a UTI. Which one is safe?"

REASONING:
- Treatment target: Urinary Tract Infection (explicit)
- Drug class: antibiotic
- Safety constraint 1: Current medication Warfarin (check interactions)
- Strategy: TREATS UTI AND is antibiotic AND NOT INTERACTS_WITH Warfarin

CYPHER:
MATCH (d:Drug)-[:TREATS]->(c:Condition {name: "Urinary Tract Infection"})
WHERE toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "antibiotic"
  AND NOT (d)-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(:Drug {name: "Warfarin"})
RETURN d.name AS name, "Drug" AS type

─────────────────────────────────
Example 10: Current medication context
─────────────────────────────────
User: "I'm on Apixaban and have chronic kidney disease. Which blood thinner is safest?"

REASONING:
- Current medication: Apixaban (context, but patient asking for alternative)
- Drug class: blood thinner (anticoagulant)
- Treatment target: AF or DVT (what blood thinners treat - implied)
- Safety constraint: Chronic Kidney Disease (patient condition)
- Strategy: Find anticoagulants treating AF/DVT that are NOT CONTRAINDICATED_IN CKD

CYPHER:
MATCH (d:Drug)-[:TREATS]->(indication:Condition)
WHERE indication.name IN ["Atrial Fibrillation", "Deep Vein Thrombosis"]
  AND (toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "doac" OR 
       toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "vitamin k antagonist" OR 
       toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "lmwh")
  AND NOT (d)-[:CONTRAINDICATED_IN]->(:Condition {name: "Chronic Kidney Disease"})
RETURN d.name AS name, "Drug" AS type

─────────────────────────────────
Example 11: Specific drug class for condition
─────────────────────────────────
User: "Which antibiotics can treat pneumonia?"

REASONING:
- Treatment target: Community-Acquired Pneumonia (explicit)
- Drug class: antibiotics
- Strategy: TREATS pneumonia AND is antibiotic class

CYPHER:
MATCH (d:Drug)-[:TREATS]->(c:Condition {name: "Community-Acquired Pneumonia"})
WHERE toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "antibiotic"
RETURN d.name AS name, "Drug" AS type

─────────────────────────────────
Example 12: Multiple medications interaction check
─────────────────────────────────
User: "I take Metformin and Simvastatin. Can I take Amoxicillin?"

REASONING:
- Starting entities: All three drugs mentioned
- Goal: Check if Amoxicillin interacts with Metformin or Simvastatin
- Strategy: Start from all three drugs for beam search to explore interactions

CYPHER:
MATCH (d:Drug)
WHERE d.name IN ["Metformin", "Simvastatin", "Amoxicillin"]
RETURN d.name AS name, "Drug" AS type

─────────────────────────────────
Example 13: Drug-drug interaction check (Can I take X and Y together?)
─────────────────────────────────
User: "Can I take Simvastatin and Clarithromycin together?"
User: "I'm on Rivaroxaban and starting Erythromycin. Is this safe?"

REASONING:
- Starting entities: Both drugs mentioned (Simvastatin & Clarithromycin, or Rivaroxaban & Erythromycin)
- Goal: Check if they can be taken together (interaction check)
- Strategy: Return BOTH drugs as starting nodes so beam search can explore INTERACTS_WITH relationship
- CRITICAL: For interaction_check queries, we need BOTH drugs as starting nodes

CYPHER:
MATCH (d:Drug)
WHERE d.name IN ["Simvastatin", "Clarithromycin"]
RETURN d.name AS name, "Drug" AS type

For Rivaroxaban + Erythromycin:
MATCH (d:Drug)
WHERE d.name IN ["Rivaroxaban", "Erythromycin"]
RETURN d.name AS name, "Drug" AS type

─────────────────────────────────
Example 14: Avoid query - find drugs that INTERACT (not contraindicated)
─────────────────────────────────
User: "I'm on Simvastatin for cholesterol and need pneumonia treatment. Which antibiotic should I avoid?"

REASONING:
- Current medication: Simvastatin
- Treatment target: Community-Acquired Pneumonia (pneumonia)
- Drug class: antibiotic
- Query intent: "avoid" = find drugs that INTERACT with Simvastatin
- Strategy: Find antibiotics treating pneumonia that INTERACT with Simvastatin

CYPHER:
MATCH (d:Drug)-[:TREATS]->(c:Condition {name: "Community-Acquired Pneumonia"})
WHERE toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "antibiotic"
  AND (d)-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(:Drug {name: "Simvastatin"})
RETURN d.name AS name, "Drug" AS type


================================================================================
KEY TAKEAWAYS:
================================================================================
1. "Safe with X" → X is a SAFETY CONSTRAINT (NOT treatment target)
2. Drug classes have implied treatments (blood thinner → AF/DVT, antibiotic → infection)
3. "Avoid/unsafe" queries → Look for CONTRAINDICATED_IN or INTERACTS_WITH relationships
4. "Safe" queries → Look for absence of contraindications (NOT CONTRAINDICATED_IN, NOT INTERACTS_WITH)
5. Current medications → Check for INTERACTS_WITH
6. Always start from what's being TREATED, filter by safety constraints
7. For "Can I take X and Y together?" queries → Start from both drugs (beam search explores interactions)
8. For "Which drugs to avoid?" → Find drugs that ARE contraindicated or DO interact
9. Colloquial terms: "irregular heartbeat" = AF, "high cholesterol" = Hyperlipidemia, "UTI" = Urinary Tract Infection
10. Patient context phrases: "I'm on X", "taking X", "someone on X" → current medication (check interactions)

================================================================================
CRITICAL INFORMATION - READ THIS FIRST:
================================================================================
The user is asking which medications to AVOID. 

The medications listed below were found by executing a Cypher query that searched for drugs with the relationship CONTRAINDICATED_IN. This means these drugs are CONTRAINDICATED (prohibited/unsafe) for {safety_condition if safety_condition else condition}.

These drugs are NOT safe options. They are NOT "may require caution". They are CONTRAINDICATED and MUST be avoided.

================================================================================

❌ Medications to AVOID (contraindicated in graph - DO NOT USE):
{safe_text}

⚠️ Medications requiring dose adjustment (use with caution, per graph data):
{adjust_text}

================================================================================
MANDATORY ANSWER FORMAT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:
================================================================================

1. START your answer with this EXACT sentence:
   "The following medications are CONTRAINDICATED and should be AVOIDED for {safety_condition if safety_condition else condition}:"

2. For EACH medication in the "Medications to AVOID" list, use this format:
   "[Drug Name] is CONTRAINDICATED and should be AVOIDED for {safety_condition if safety_condition else condition} because [reason]."

3. DO NOT use these phrases:
   - "may require caution"
   - "should consult their healthcare provider to determine the safest option"
   - "generally considered safer"
   - "use with caution"
   - "assess suitability"
   
   These phrases imply the drugs might be safe. They are NOT safe - they are CONTRAINDICATED.

4. USE these phrases instead:
   - "is CONTRAINDICATED"
   - "should be AVOIDED"
   - "must not be used"
   - "do not use"
   - "is not suitable"

5. Explain WHY each medication is contraindicated (e.g., renal clearance issues, risk of bleeding, etc.)

6. If there are medications requiring adjustment, clearly separate them as "use with caution" (not contraindicated)

================================================================================

Generate your answer following the MANDATORY FORMAT above. Start with the exact sentence from point 1."""

{schema_info}

**CRITICAL RULES**:
1. INTERACTS_WITH is BIDIRECTIONAL - always use: (d1)-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(d2)
2. TREATS goes FROM Drug TO Condition: (d:Drug)-[:TREATS]->(c:Condition)
3. Use exact property matching: {{name: "Exact Name"}}
4. For drug class filtering, use the STEM form directly in the query (not as parameter):
   - "antibiotics" → use: WHERE toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "antibiot"
   - "statins" → use: WHERE toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "statin"
   - "blood thinners" → use: WHERE (toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "doac" OR toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "vitamin k antagonist" OR toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "lmwh")
   - This ensures better matching regardless of plural/singular
5. For interaction filtering, use: WHERE NOT (d)-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(:Drug {{name: $avoid_drug}})
6. Always return: d.name AS drug, d.class AS drug_class (and other fields as needed)

**FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES**:

Example 1: Simple aggregation - What treats a condition?
Query: "What medications treat diabetes?"
Entities: drugs=[], conditions=["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"], drug_classes=[]
Cypher:
MATCH (d:Drug)-[:TREATS]->(c:Condition {{name: $condition}})
RETURN d.name AS drug, 
       d.class AS drug_class,
       d.pregnancy_category AS pregnancy_category
ORDER BY d.name
Parameters: {{condition: "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"}}

Example 2: Drug class + condition - Which [class] treats [condition]?
Query: "Which antibiotics treat urinary tract infections?"
Entities: drugs=[], conditions=["Urinary Tract Infection"], drug_classes=["antibiotics"]
Cypher:
MATCH (d:Drug)-[:TREATS]->(c:Condition {{name: $condition}})
WHERE toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "antibiot"
RETURN d.name AS drug, d.class AS drug_class
ORDER BY d.name
Parameters: {{condition: "Urinary Tract Infection"}}
Note: Use stem "antibiot" for better matching, not "antibiotic" or "antibiotics"

Example 3: Two conditions - What treats X and is safe for Y?
Query: "What blood pressure medications are safe for pregnancy?"
Entities: drugs=[], conditions=["Hypertension", "Pregnancy"], drug_classes=[]
Cypher:
MATCH (d:Drug)-[:TREATS]->(c:Condition {{name: $treat_condition}})
OPTIONAL MATCH (d)-[contra:CONTRAINDICATED_IN]->(safety:Condition {{name: $safety_condition}})
OPTIONAL MATCH (d)-[adjust:REQUIRES_ADJUSTMENT]->(safety2:Condition {{name: $safety_condition}})
WITH d, contra, adjust
WHERE contra IS NULL
RETURN d.name AS drug, 
       d.class AS drug_class,
       d.pregnancy_category AS pregnancy_category,
       CASE WHEN adjust IS NOT NULL THEN true ELSE false END AS needs_adjustment
ORDER BY d.name
Parameters: {{treat_condition: "Hypertension", safety_condition: "Pregnancy"}}

Example 4: Drug class + condition + drug constraint - Which [class] treats [condition] and doesn't interact with [drug]?
Query: "Which antibiotic treats pneumonia and won't interact with Glipizide?"
Entities: drugs=["Glipizide"], conditions=["Community-Acquired Pneumonia"], drug_classes=["antibiotics"]
Cypher:
MATCH (d:Drug)
WHERE toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "antibiot"
  AND (d)-[:TREATS]->(:Condition {{name: $treat_condition}})
  AND NOT (d)-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(:Drug {{name: $avoid_drug}})
RETURN d.name AS drug, d.class AS drug_class
ORDER BY d.name
Parameters: {{treat_condition: "Community-Acquired Pneumonia", avoid_drug: "Glipizide"}}
Note: Use stem "antibiot" for drug class matching, and treat_condition is the condition needing treatment

Example 5: Drug class + condition + drug constraint (alternative pattern)
Query: "I take Glipizide for diabetes and have pneumonia. Which antibiotic won't drop my sugar?"
Entities: drugs=["Glipizide"], conditions=["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus", "Community-Acquired Pneumonia"], drug_classes=["antibiotics"]
Intent: Find antibiotics that treat pneumonia and don't interact with Glipizide
Cypher:
MATCH (d:Drug)
WHERE toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "antibiot"
  AND (d)-[:TREATS]->(:Condition {{name: $treat_condition}})
  AND NOT (d)-[:INTERACTS_WITH]-(:Drug {{name: $avoid_drug}})
RETURN d.name AS drug, d.class AS drug_class
ORDER BY d.name
Note: treat_condition should be "Community-Acquired Pneumonia" (the condition needing treatment), NOT "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus" (patient state)

Example 6: "Avoid" query - Which [class] should I avoid for [condition]?
Query: "I have atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease. Which blood thinner should I avoid?"
Entities: drugs=[], conditions=["Atrial Fibrillation", "Chronic Kidney Disease"], drug_classes=["blood thinners"]
Intent: Find blood thinners that treat atrial fibrillation but are CONTRAINDICATED in chronic kidney disease (to avoid)
Cypher:
MATCH (d:Drug)
WHERE (toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "doac" OR toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "vitamin k antagonist" OR toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "lmwh")
  AND (d)-[:TREATS]->(:Condition {{name: $treat_condition}})
MATCH (d)-[:CONTRAINDICATED_IN]->(:Condition {{name: $safety_condition}})
RETURN d.name AS drug, d.class AS drug_class
ORDER BY d.name
Parameters: {{treat_condition: "Atrial Fibrillation", safety_condition: "Chronic Kidney Disease"}}
Note: For "avoid" queries, find drugs that are CONTRAINDICATED_IN (not safe ones). For blood thinners, match on actual class names: "DOAC", "Vitamin K Antagonist", "LMWH".

Example 7: "Avoid" query fallback - If no contraindications, show "requires adjustment"
Query: "I have atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease. Which blood thinner should I avoid?"
Entities: drugs=[], conditions=["Atrial Fibrillation", "Chronic Kidney Disease"], drug_classes=["blood thinners"]
Intent: If no contraindications found, show drugs that require adjustment (use with caution)
Cypher:
MATCH (d:Drug)
WHERE (toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "doac" OR toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "vitamin k antagonist" OR toLower(d.class) CONTAINS "lmwh")
  AND (d)-[:TREATS]->(:Condition {{name: $treat_condition}})
MATCH (d)-[:REQUIRES_ADJUSTMENT]->(:Condition {{name: $safety_condition}})
RETURN d.name AS drug, d.class AS drug_class, true AS needs_adjustment
ORDER BY d.name
Parameters: {{treat_condition: "Atrial Fibrillation", safety_condition: "Chronic Kidney Disease"}}
Note: This is a fallback if Example 6 returns no results. Shows drugs requiring dose adjustment (caution, not avoid). For blood thinners, match on actual class names: "DOAC", "Vitamin K Antagonist", "LMWH".

**KEY INSIGHTS**:
- When drug class is mentioned, filter by drug class FIRST (before TREATS)
- When multiple conditions exist, determine which is the "treat" condition (what we're treating) vs "safety" condition (constraint)
- When a drug is mentioned as constraint, use NOT INTERACTS_WITH to filter it out
- The "treat" condition is usually the one that needs treatment (pneumonia, UTI, infection, hypertension, atrial fibrillation)
- The "safety" condition is usually a patient state (pregnancy, diabetes, kidney disease)
- For "avoid" queries (user asks "which should I avoid"), find drugs that are CONTRAINDICATED_IN (not safe ones with WHERE contra IS NULL)
- For "avoid" queries, ALWAYS include the indication (treat_condition) - e.g., anticoagulants that TREAT atrial fibrillation but are CONTRAINDICATED in CKD
- CRITICAL: If drug class is mentioned with multiple conditions, the "treat" condition is the one that needs treatment with that class
  Example: "antibiotic for pneumonia" → pneumonia is treat_condition, diabetes is safety_condition
- For drug class filtering, use the stem: "antibiot" (not "antibiotic" or "antibiotics") for better matching

**YOUR TASK**:
Generate a Cypher query that answers the query above. Follow the examples closely.
- If drug class is mentioned, filter by drug class FIRST
- If condition is mentioned, filter by TREATS relationship
- If drug is mentioned as constraint, filter by NOT INTERACTS_WITH
- If multiple conditions, determine which is "treat" vs "safety" based on context

Return ONLY the Cypher query, no explanations. Use parameterized queries with $param_name."""
