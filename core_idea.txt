2. Multi-hop reasoning engine with think-on-graph beam search
What makes this cutting-edge: ICLR 2024's Think-on-Graph architecture treats LLMs as agents that iteratively explore knowledge graphs using beam search, maintaining multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. Springer +2 This addresses hallucination by grounding every reasoning step in the graph structure while leveraging LLMs' planning capabilities.
Technical architecture: Implement a beam search-based reasoning system where an LLM agent explores a knowledge graph to answer complex questions requiring multiple hops. The system maintains K promising reasoning paths, scores each path based on graph structure and semantic relevance, iteratively expands the most promising paths, and synthesizes the final answer from discovered evidence. Core components include the beam search engine, path scoring mechanism, iterative retrieval based on intermediate results, and answer generation that explains the reasoning chain.
Implementation approach: Set up Neo4j or FalkorDB and load a multi-hop QA dataset (MetaQA, HotPotQA) in Week 1; implement beam search algorithm with configurable beam width and path scoring in Week 2; integrate LLM (GPT-4, Llama-3.1-70B, or Mistral) for reasoning decisions and answer generation in Week 3; evaluate on benchmarks, add visualization of reasoning paths, and optimize in Week 4. The path scoring mechanism is critical—combine graph connectivity, semantic similarity, and LLM confidence scores.
Datasets and frameworks: Use MetaQA or HotPotQA for multi-hop question answering benchmarks. arXiv The original Think-on-Graph paper provides implementation guidance. Extension opportunities include adding visualization of reasoning paths using D3.js or Cytoscape, implementing with local models like Llama-3-8B for cost efficiency, or creating domain-specific versions for biomedical or financial knowledge.
Why this impresses employers: Demonstrates deep understanding of graph algorithms and LLM limitations; shows ability to implement recent research papers (ICLR 2024); addresses critical hallucination problems with explainable reasoning; provides quantifiable performance metrics on standard benchmarks. The reasoning paths are interpretable, crucial for high-stakes domains.
